    title: "Term Loan – General Loan Scheme",
    description:
      "Income generation: self-employment, small business, trading, services, transport, agriculture & allied activities, artisan/traditional trades.",
    amount: "Up to ₹15.00 Lakh per beneficiary",
    interest:
      "• Up to ₹5 Lakh → 6% p.a.\n• ₹5–10 Lakh → 7% p.a.\n• ₹10–15 Lakh → 8% p.a.",
    repayment: "Quarterly EMI; up to 8 years, including ~6-month moratorium.",
    detail: `The General Loan Scheme is NBCFDC’s flagship financial assistance program designed to help individuals from backward-class communities start or expand income-generating activities. This scheme covers a wide variety of sectors such as small businesses, retail shops, service-based ventures, trading activities, agricultural and allied activities, transport vehicles, artisan and traditional trades, and micro-enterprises. It aims to empower economically weaker individuals by offering loans at highly concessional interest rates, making entrepreneurship more affordable and accessible.

Under this scheme, beneficiaries can avail loans up to ₹15 lakh, depending on the nature and requirement of the project. NBCFDC typically contributes the major share of the project cost, while the remaining is contributed by the beneficiary or channel partner. The interest rate increases gradually across loan slabs to ensure fairness and viability — 6% p.a. up to ₹5 lakh, 7% p.a. for ₹5–10 lakh, and 8% p.a. for ₹10–15 lakh. The repayment period extends up to 8 years, including a moratorium period of around six months where the beneficiary need not pay the principal amount.

This scheme is ideal for individuals planning to become self-employed, expand an existing business, or start a sustainable livelihood project. It is designed to promote economic independence, create employment opportunities, and uplift socially and economically weaker households.`

    title: "Term Loan – Education Loan Scheme",
    description:
      "Higher education for backward-class students in India or abroad (professional, technical, vocational courses).",
    amount: "India: up to ₹15 Lakh | Abroad: up to ₹20 Lakh",
    interest: "• Boys → 4% p.a.\n• Girls → 3.5% p.a.",
    repayment: "Moratorium during course; repayment after completion; total up to ~15 years.",
    detail: `The Education Loan Scheme enables students belonging to backward-class families to pursue higher studies in India or abroad without financial barriers. It financially supports a wide range of courses including professional degrees, technical programs, vocational training, postgraduate studies, and specialized skill-oriented courses. The scheme ensures that deserving students can access quality education and build strong career foundations.

The loan typically covers essential expenses such as tuition fees, hostel charges, examination fees, books, educational equipment, travel expenses (for overseas study), and other academic requirements. Students can borrow up to ₹15 lakh for studies in India and up to ₹20 lakh for studying abroad. NBCFDC offers very low interest rates — 4% per annum for boys and 3.5% per annum for girls — making higher education significantly more affordable.

A major benefit of this scheme is the extended moratorium period, which covers the full course duration plus additional time before repayment begins. The total repayment period, including the moratorium, can extend up to around 15 years, reducing financial stress on the student. This scheme is perfect for students wanting to achieve academic and professional excellence but lacking financial resources.`

The scheme provides loans of up to ₹2 lakh at an extremely low interest rate of just 5% per annum, with NBCFDC funding the major share of the loan amount. The beneficiary contribution is minimal, ensuring that financial limitations do not prevent women from starting or expanding their businesses. The repayment period extends up to 8 years, including a moratorium period, which gives women enough time to stabilize their business before beginning repayments.

This scheme is specifically designed to empower women entrepreneurs, increase their participation in income-generating activities, and uplift families by improving female economic participation. It is one of the most beneficiary-friendly schemes offered by NBCFDC.`

    detail: `The Individual Loan Scheme targets entrepreneurs who require greater financial support than what microloan schemes provide. It is ideal for individuals planning to launch or expand medium-sized enterprises such as manufacturing units, workshops, fabrication centers, repair units, service-based companies, or any commercial activity requiring significant initial investment.

The scheme offers loans up to ₹25 lakh, making it suitable for ventures that need larger working capital or fixed capital investment. The interest rate depends on the loan amount — 7% per annum for loans up to ₹1.25 lakh and 8% per annum for higher loan slabs. NBCFDC usually finances a major portion of the project cost, while the remaining is contributed by the beneficiary or channel partner.

The repayment period varies between 4 to 7 years, depending on the size and nature of the project. The scheme can also support educational needs for long-duration courses under a separate repayment structure.

The financing pattern is extremely favorable, with NBCFDC typically contributing a major share of the loan amount.

Repayment is spread over about 4 years, including a moratorium period. The scheme aims to uplift women economically, build leadership and financial literacy within SHGs, and improve household income security.

      "Micro-loans to individuals who are not in SHGs but need small capital for self-employment.",
    amount: "Up to ₹1.25 Lakh",
    interest: "Around 6% p.a.",
    repayment: "Repayment typically within 4 years.",
    detail: `This scheme provides small loans to individual beneficiaries who are not part of SHGs but require modest capital for starting or improving micro-businesses. It supports activities such as fruit and vegetable vending, small retail shops, repair services, tailoring, dairy, poultry, handicrafts, and household-based production.

The maximum loan available is ₹1.25 lakh, which makes it ideal for quick-start livelihood projects with lower investment needs. The interest rate is concessional (around 6% per annum), ensuring affordability. NBCFDC usually covers a major part of the project cost, with the beneficiary or channel partner contributing the remaining portion.

With a repayment period of around 4 years, this scheme is designed to help individuals achieve sustainable self-employment and gradually expand their micro-enterprises without heavy financial burden.`

    interest: "Around 12% p.a. (MFI operational costs).",
    repayment: "Repayment around 4 years (varies by MFI).",
    detail: `The NBFC-MFI Loan Scheme is implemented through Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) and NBFC-MFIs to ensure credit reaches beneficiaries in remote, underserved, or financially excluded areas. It is ideal for backward-class individuals who may not have direct access to banks, SHGs, or formal loan channels. This scheme supports micro-enterprises, group activities, and livelihood improvement programs.

Each beneficiary can receive up to ₹1.25 lakh, with total group-level lending reaching up to ₹15 lakh. The financing pattern typically involves NBCFDC contributing the major share and the partner institution providing the rest. Since MFIs incur operational costs, the interest rate under this scheme is higher (around 12% per annum), but it ensures faster processing, doorstep servicing, and wider coverage.

Repayment is usually completed within about 4 years, depending on the MFI’s policies. This scheme is crucial for last-mile delivery of financial support to backward-class individuals living in rural, tribal, and hard-to-reach areas.`
